# Image Processing API

## Overview

This project aims to give you a real-world scenario in which you would read and write to your disk via a Node.js express server rather than a database. The project you create serves two purposes: to prepare you for setting up scalable code and architecture for real-world projects and tie together some of the most popular middleware and utilities found in Node.js projects. This project barely touches the surface of what is possible but will prove your ability to use what youâ€™ve learned in real-world scenarios.

## How to build and start the server

The project can be built and run in the following ways

### 1. Install all dependencies

`yarn`

### 2. Build

`yarn build`

This command will build the typeScript code into JavaScript and save them in the `./build` folder.

### 3. Start the Server

`yarn start`

This command will start the server running on port `3000`.

## Testing and Linting

Here, I will show you how to run the test and also how to check that our code respects all the eslint rules.

### 1. Linting

`yarn lint`

### 2. Testing

`yarn test`
